# TkNotes

Ever wanted to take notes in a *highly optimized* app made with the best language for add
development ever?! Now you can, here's a note-taking app make with Tkinter.

## Architecture

The app has cloud storage which is implemented as a dummy file-backed database for this proof of
concept app. In reality it would be replaced with a GraphQL API, Firebase, or something similar.

The GUI uses the MVC architecture (not a fan).

## Setup (macOS)

```sh
brew install python-tk
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
